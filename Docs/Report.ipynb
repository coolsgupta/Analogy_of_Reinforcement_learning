    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "In this project, we have done a comparative study of conventional Table based Q learning algorithm with Deep Q learning algorithm. The aim was to compare and contrast the performance of various algorithms on similar environment. We have used ‘OpenAI Gym’ environments like Cartpole and Mountain Car to do a comparative study of Deep Q learning and conventional Q learning algorithm. The results show that where conventional Q learning algorithms couldn’t even achieve satisfactory results, Deep Q algorithms achieved almost perfect score in the same game environment."

    "# Project Overview\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning is an area of machine learning, where an agent learns by interacting with its environment to achieve an objective. In the conventional method the model uses a Q table to store and retrieve the actions for every state based on the rewards earned by the model in the past. This lookup Q table helps the model decide the future course of action. Though this model can be efficient for small state space systems, a system with large number of state-action pairs cannot be handled using this conventional method. Also, this method employs a lookup table for the system which makes it limited to that particular system and for each new system a new model has to be designed which makes it inefficient and makes it distant from human-like learning.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In contrast Deep learning employs neural networks which make it closer to human-like learning as a single model can be used to work on different environments without any prior knowledge of the environment. The model learns by itself through the rewards it achieves on taking certain actions. Thus, a single model can be used to work on similar but different environments viz gaming environments that involve maximizing a particular score based on the actions taken on any state. Using Deep Q Learning a single model trained for a particular environment can be made to work on other models too which may have different rules, states and set of action. Thus, the model is not limited to state-action pairs and is flexible to work on different environments too without much modification.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "For this project we have used two environments designed and developed by ‘OpenAI Gym’. These are ‘Cartpole-V1’ and ‘MountainCar-V0’ (explained in detail in the environment and dataset section)."

    "# Metrics\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The models involved in the project has been compared and contrasted on the basis of four evaluation metrics. There are:\n",
    "1.\t<b>Score</b>: This evaluation metric is based on the goal of the environment and denotes how close the agent got to reaching the goal for each episode independently. This metric is independent of independent actions as the agent may take some wrong actions but if it manages to reach the goal state it has earned the score awarded.<br>\n",
    "2.\t<b>Total Reward</b>: The evaluation metric provided by OpenAI Gym provides the reward earned by the agent for each action that it takes. For comparison we took a sum of all the rewards earned by the agent in an episode and used it as an evaluation metric called the Total Reward. Unlike the score, this is affected by each action taken by the agent and hence even if the agent manages to reach the goal state, it may encounter negative rewards for any wrong action chosen.<br>\n",
    "3.\t<b>Average Score</b>: Since the instantaneous scores can be very random and hence hard to study, we smoothened the curve using the averages. The average score depicts the mean of the scores earned by the agent up to the current episode as shown in the results section of this report.<br>\n",
    "4.\t<b>Average Reward</b>: Similar to score, the instantaneous rewards can also be very random and hence hard to study, we smoothened the curve using the averages. The average reward depicts the mean of the total rewards earned by the agent up to the current episode as shown in the results section of this report.<br>\n"

    "<b>Reinforcement Learning</b> is a type of machine learning that allows you to create AI agents that learn from the environment by interacting with it. Reinforcement learning provides the capacity for us not only to teach an artificial agent how to act, but to allow it to learn through it’s own interactions with an environment.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "One of the most important aspects of reinforcement learning is that it takes into account that taking an action does not necessarily only affect the immediate reward, but it may have an impact in the future rewards as well. This way, taking what seems to be the best action now may not be the best decision in the long term. This concept is known as <b>delayed reward</b>.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Another of the key aspects of reinforcement learning is that in order to maximize the reward we must follow what we have learned is best, but in order to learn that we have to also explore randomly sometimes. This is called the <b>exploration-exploitation dilemma</b>.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "## Q Learning Algorithm\n",
    "Q Learning is a popular, <b>off-policy</b> learning algorithm that utilizes the <b>Q function</b>. It is based on the simple premise that the best policy is the one that selects the action with the highest total future reward.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In a reinforcement learning model, an agent takes actions in an environment with the goal of maximizing a cumulative reward. The basic reinforcement learning model consists of: a set of environment states S; a set of actions A; rules of transitioning between states; rules that determine the scalar immediate reward of a transition; and rules that describe what the agent observes.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Q-Learning is a <b>model-free</b> form of Reinforcement Learning. If S is a set of states, A is a set of actions, 𝜸 is the discount factor, is the step size. Then we can understand Q-Learning by this. <br>\n",

    "In Q-learning, the value of the Q function for each state is updated iteratively based on the new rewards it receives. At its most basic level, the algorithm looks at the difference between (a) its current estimate of total future reward and (b) the estimate generated from its most recent experience. After it calculates this difference (a - b), it adjusts its current estimate up or down a bit based on the number. Q-learning uses a couple of parameters to allow us to tweak how the process works. The first is the learning rate, represented by the Greek letter α (alpha). This is a number between 0 and 1 that determines the extent to which newly learned information will impact the existing estimates. A low α means that the agent will put less stock into the new information it learns, and a high α means that new information will more quickly override older information. The second parameter is the discount rate, g. The higher the discount rate, the less important future rewards are valued.<br>\n",

    "We first carry out an action a and observe the reward r and resulting new state s.

Immediate payment always worth more for same amount of money). Lastly, we add the current reward to the discounted future reward to get the target value. Subtracting our current prediction from the target gives the loss. Squaring this value allows us to punish the large loss value more and treat the negative values same as the positive values.\n"

Also, they dropped as low as 11.5 and 4.5 and reaching just 21.56 and 11.57 as the maximum values for Cartpole. For Mountain Car the average score dropped to -0.39 while the average score remained close to -209 showing that the agent never reached the goal state. The cause for the same is shown in the figure 16, i.e. the growth of the Q table. \n",
    "The Q learning agent when encounters a new state, creates an entry in the Q table and takes a random action for the instance and updates the Q values of the actions for that state accordingly so that it can refer to the same in order to possibly take a better action when it encounters the same state again. This leads to the problem known as the growth rate of the Q table. The same can be observed in figure 16 as it shows that by end of trial number 4605 the table already consisted of 107436 states for Cartpole and 917784 for Mountain Car and yet it can be observed from the slope that it would certainly increase further if subjected to more number of trials.\n",

The DQN agent however showed remarkable performance in both the environments and clearly outclassed the Q learning agent even when trained for much lesser number of trials than the Q learning agent.\n"

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The Results from the above simulation and study clearly show that Q-Learning shows remarkable performance in environments with a small State-Space, however fails to achieve the same in environments of higher dimensions. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The Q-Learning agent does perform better than Random-Exploration but fails to achieve higher rewards or reach the goal state in many cases. The reason behind being the ‘Curse of Dimensionality’, due to which the size of the Q-table increases exponentially and hence it becomes impossible to iterate over all the possible policies even with a high number of training trials resulting in the poor performance in such high dimensional spaces.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep-Reinforcement Learning (here, Deep-Q Learning) manages to overcome this problem by following generalization.  The aim of the model is to figure the latent trends in the data gathered by exploring the environment and hence generate a model that can predict the possibly correct (not necessarily optimal) action. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The results substantiate the same since the model manages to achieve very high scores and, in many instances, ‘a perfect score’ even in much lesser training trials. This strengthens the fact that the DQN-Agent overcomes the limitation of Policy Iteration Q-learning, to explore all states individually, and even with a much-limited exploration can offer remarkable results and hence outperforms the Policy Iteration Q-Learning algorithm.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Also, the agents gives remarkable results for two different environments of same category without any alternation of model architechture or hyper-parameters showing that the agent is robust to environments of the same class for a long period of training and testing, hence prooving its reliability.\n"
